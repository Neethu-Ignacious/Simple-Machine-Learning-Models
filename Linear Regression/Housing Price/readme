This model will predict housing prices for regions in the USA.

The dataset USA_Housing.csv contains the following columns:

'Avg. Area Income': Avg. Income of residents of the city house is located in. 'Avg. Area House Age': Avg Age of Houses in same city 'Avg. Area Number of Rooms': Avg Number of Rooms for Houses in same city 'Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms': Avg Number of Bedrooms for Houses in same city 'Area Population': Population of city house is located in 'Price': Price that the house sold at 'Address': Address for the house

Regression Evaluation Metrics Here are three common evaluation metrics for regression problems:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is the mean of the absolute value of the errors:

1/𝑛∑𝑖=1𝑛|𝑦𝑖−𝑦̂ 𝑖|

Mean Squared Error (MSE) is the mean of the squared errors:

1/𝑛∑𝑖=1𝑛(𝑦𝑖−𝑦̂ 𝑖)2

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is the square root of the mean of the squared errors:

sqrt(1/𝑛∑𝑖=1𝑛(𝑦𝑖−𝑦̂𝑖)2 )

Comparing these metrics:

MAE is the easiest to understand, because it's the average error. MSE is more popular than MAE, because MSE "punishes" larger errors, which tends to be useful in the real world. RMSE is even more popular than MSE, because RMSE is interpretable in the "y" units.
