This model will predict if a clothing company needs to focus their efforts on their mobile app or their website

Interpreting the coefficients:

Holding all other features fixed, a 1 unit increase in Avg. Session Length is associated with an increase of 25.98 total dollars spent. Holding all other features fixed, a 1 unit increase in Time on App is associated with an increase of 38.59 total dollars spent. Holding all other features fixed, a 1 unit increase in Time on Website is associated with an increase of 0.19 total dollars spent. Holding all other features fixed, a 1 unit increase in Length of Membership is associated with an increase of 61.27 total dollars spent.

Do the company should focus more on their mobile app or on their website?

This is tricky, there are two ways to think about this: Develop the Website to catch up to the performance of the mobile app, or develop the app more since that is what is working better. This sort of answer really depends on the other factors going on at the company, and we would probably want to explore the relationship between Length of Membership and the App/Website before coming to a conclusion.
